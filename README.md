## About

Binderhub is super cool so I wanted to try out hosting a notebook on there, hence this repo. I used [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) to create it. Ohh, and the notebook! It was a homework assignment, the rest you can figure it out by looking at the notebook file itself.
